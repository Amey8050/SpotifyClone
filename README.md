# Spotify Clone 🎵

Welcome to **Spotify Clone**, a minimalist and visually appealing music player built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project recreates basic Spotify functionality, allowing users to play songs seamlessly without requiring a database or server-side code.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Playlist**: A curated set of songs ready to play.
- **Play/Pause Controls**: Intuitive playback functionality.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: User interface dynamically adapts to interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, providing a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **No Database**: Songs are embedded directly into the code, simplifying storage and retrieval.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Instead of using a database, all song information (such as titles, artists, file paths, and cover images) is stored in a **JavaScript array**. This makes the project lightweight and eliminates the need for backend services.

### Example of Song Storage:
```javascript
const songs = [
  {
    title: "Song One",
    artist: "Artist One",
    filePath: "songs/song1.mp3",
    coverImage: "images/cover1.jpg"
  },
  {
    title: "Song Two",
    artist: "Artist Two",
    filePath: "songs/song2.mp3",
    coverImage: "images/cover2.jpg"
  }
];
```

The audio files are placed in the `songs` folder, and metadata (such as file paths and cover images) is referenced directly in the JavaScript code.
